ACPID is used to handle some keyboard keys on newer ThinkPad models.

This workaround also requires acpi_fakekey, to generate missing keys.

Specifically - so far - the key that should generate XF86AudioMicMute is handled using ACPID.
File to reference for keycodes: /usr/share/acpi-support/key-constants - requires acpi-support to be installed.

Run the following command to install the event file to support the key.
```sh
echo "event=button[ /]\
action=acpi_fakekey 190 # producess XF86AudioMicMute in X\
" | sudo tee /etc/acpi/events/micmute-acpi > /dev/null 
```

echo 0, 8, 10 > /proc/acpi/ibm/beep to turn off beep (sometimes?)
